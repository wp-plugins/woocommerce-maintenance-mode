Store messages or redirects on all WooCommerce pages for non admins. Other pages/posts unaffected. Ideal for store maintenance or store wide notices.

== Description ==

Easily choose between displaying a message or specifying an existing page or external URL to redirect users. This will be applied to all users that are not-logged in and are without shop editing capabilities.This will only affect WooCommerce store pages and no other pages or posts on your website. 

Easily select from your websites existing pages to pull in content for your messages or as a destination for your redirects. Alternatively use the Maintenance WYSIWYG field to create your own custom messages (just like on a page or post). 

Set an end date that will automatically resume your store to normal view and enjoy the flexibility of being able to adjust the frequency at which to display your store messages or redirects to your users. 

Requires WordPress 3.0 + and WooCommerce 2.0 +.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin isn't working?! =

When previewing your lightbox popup, in-page message or testing your redirect you MUST remember to logout and then view it or use a secondary browser that is not logged into your Dashboard to view it. One of the conditions for the plugin to display or redirect on WooCommerce pages is that the user is NOT logged in, but its easy to forget this when working or testing things on your site. (I have done it plenty.)

Also remember to either use the 0 value for cookie settings within your plugin whilst testing or use the delete all cookies button and then test again. Often it is not working because the cookie has already been set previously and you have just forgotten about it :)
